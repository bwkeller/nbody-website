                            <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
                        <p >The N-Body Shop collaboration strives to provide an
                        inclusive and safe environment for all of its members.
                        We welcome the inclusion of people with diverse skills,
                        backgrounds, experiences, and opinions and recognize
                        that such diversity is critical to the realization of
                        our scientific endeavors. It is our priority that all
                        group members are heard and feel confident in freely
                        expressing their opinions. We also recognize the
                        important value of mentorship and the obligation of our
                        more senior members to actively support the scientific
                        and career aspirations of our younger members. To
                        encourage the cultivation of such an inclusive and
                        productive environment, we have formulated the
                        following code of conduct to which all members of the
                        collaboration are expected to adhere. Resources and
                        guidelines for further cultivating this environment is
                        included in our Best Practices document. When
                        applicable, N-body Shop members will adhere to these
                        guidelines when interacting with the community outside
                        of our collaboration. This includes, but is not limited
                        to, interactions at conferences, academic
                        talks/seminars/colloquia, and public outreach
                        events.</p>

                                nationality, ethnicity, immigration status, age, or religion. This
                                collaboration will be a bullying- and harassment-free

                                Harassment of any kind is not tolerated. This includes sustained
