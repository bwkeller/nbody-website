                            <h3>Assistant Professor, Queensborough Community College</h3>

                                Jillian has a PhD in Astronomy from the University of Washington, and is currently an 
                                assistant professor at Queensborough Community College. Jillian studies the formation 
                                and evolution of massive black holes using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. She 
                                is interested in hoï¿¼w they form in the early universe, how they grow to become the 
                                behemoths we see today, and whether or not we can find them in dwarf galaxies.  Jillian 
                                served in the U.S. Peace Corps and lived in The Gambia, West Africa, for two years, 
                                where she taught college physics and had many adventures. In her free time she enjoys 
                                knitting socks and playing roller derby. Jillian is also avidly predicting the signatures 
                                of merging black holes detectable by LISA.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Assistant Professor of Physics, Grinnell College</h3>
                            <p style="display: inline-block;">
                                <span class="image left"><img src="images/pic05.png" alt=""/></span>
                                Charlotte Christensen's research has focused on the properties of feedback-driven 
                                galactic outflows and the connection between star formation and the molecular ISM.
                            </p>

                            <p style="display: inline-block;">
                                <span class="image left"><img src="images/keller.png" alt="" /></span>
                                Ben Keller is  postdoctoral researcher in the MUSTANG group at Universit&auml;t
                                Heidelberg's Astronomisches Rechen-Institut. His current research involves
                                numerical modelling of the star formation, feedback, and interstellar medium over
                                cosmological timescales.

                            <h2><a href="http://www.nhn.ou.edu/~munshi/reborn/">Ferah Munshi</a></h2>
                            <h3>Assistant Professor, University of Oklahoma</h3>
                            <p style="display: inline-block;">
                                <span class="image left"><img src="images/pic05.png" alt=""/></span>
                                Ferah is an assistant professor at the University of Oklahoma working on studying 
                                the smallest and dimmest galaxies: from classical dwarf galaxies down into the 
                                ultrafaint and ultradiffuse regimes.  These galaxies are at the lower limits of galaxy 
                                formation and can tell us a lot about the nature of dark matter, reionization and star 
                                formation. Ferah primarily works with zoom-in simulations like the DC Justice League 
                                and the Marvel-ous Dwarfs, but is also working with the Romulus volume and cluster.  
                            </p>

                                <span class="image left"><img src="images/quinn.png" alt=""/></span>
                                Tom has a wide range of research interests ranging in scale from granular dynamics 
                                out to the large scale structure of the Universe.  The commonality in these interests 
                                is gravitational dynamics and particle based simulation of physical phenomena.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Michael Tremmel</h2>
                            <h3>YCAA Fellow, Yale University</h3>
                            <p style="display: inline-block;">
                                <span class="image left"><img src="images/tremmel.png" alt=""/></span>
                                Michael's research focuses on the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes,
                                studying in particular the dynamical evolution of SMBHs in merging galaxies, the connection
                                between SMBH feedback and galaxy evolution, and the interaction between galaxies and SMBHs with
                                their environment. As a graduate student, Michael led the design and execution of the
                                Romulus Simulations which included the implementation of a novel model for SMBH
                                formation, growth, feedback, and dynamics in cosmological simulations. In addition to
                                research, Michael is passionate about public outreach and has been heavily involved in
                                diversity efforts such as the Pre-Major in Astronomy Program at the University of
                                Washington. Michael will transition to an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship (also at Yale) in the Fall of 2020.
