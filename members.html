                                Jillian has a PhD in Astronomy from the University of Washington, and is currently an 
                                assistant professor at Queensborough Community College. Jillian studies the formation 
                                and evolution of massive black holes using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. She 
                                is interested in hoï¿¼w they form in the early universe, how they grow to become the 
                                behemoths we see today, and whether or not we can find them in dwarf galaxies. She is 
                                involved in BridgeUp:STEM, and serves on the Committee for the Status of Minorities in 
                                Astronomy. Jillian served in the U.S. Peace Corps and lived in The Gambia, West Africa, 
                                for two years, where she taught college physics and had many adventures. In her free 
                                time she enjoys knitting socks and playing roller derby.

                                Charlotte Christensen's research has focused on the properties of feedback-driven 
                                galactic outflows and the connection between star formation and the molecular ISM.

                                Ben Keller is  postdoctoral researcher in the MUSTANG group at Universit&auml;t
                                Heidelberg's Astronomisches Rechen-Institut. His current research involves
                                numerical modelling of the star formation, feedback, and interstellar medium over
                                cosmological timescales.

                            <h2><a href="http://www.nhn.ou.edu/~munshi/reborn/">Ferah Munshi</a></h2>
                            <h3>Assistant Professor, University of Oklahoma</h3>
                            <p style="display: inline-block;">
                                <span class="image left"><img src="images/pic05.png" alt=""/></span>
                                Ferah is an assistant professor at the University of Oklahoma working on studying 
                                the smallest and dimmest galaxies: from classical dwarf galaxies down into the 
                                ultrafaint and ultradiffuse regimes.  These galaxies are at the lower limits of galaxy 
                                formation and can tell us a lot about the nature of dark matter, reionization and star 
                                formation. Ferah primarily works with zoom-in simulations like the DC Justice League 
                                and the Marvel-ous Dwarfs, but is also working with the Romulus volume and cluster.
